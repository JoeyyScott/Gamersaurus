Notes:

+ Through the use of Materialize and my own design input the site is responsive on all screen sizes that I have tested personally. There may be slight issues on certain abstract displays that might need additional media queries as I experienced minor issues in the development of the project pertaining to content being too big for the viewport in very extreme cases.

### Browser Compatibility

I tested the appearance and responsiveness of the website across 6 different browsers and varying browser sizes and these are my results:

|    All Pages   | Firefox | Chrome |  IE  | Edge | Opera | Safari |
|:--------------:|:-------:|:------:|:----:|:----:|:-----:|:------:|
| Appearance     |   Good  |  Good  | Good | Good |  Good |  Good  |
| Responsiveness |   Good  |  Good  | Good | Good |  Good |  Good  |

### Bugs

+ **Search Feature** - When trying to implement this feature I had set up my index key wrong producing a multitude of errors. I was using this piece of code:

    ```mongo.db.gamersaurus.create_index([("term", "text"), ("definition", "text"), ("example", "text")])```

    + What this ended up doing was creating a collection called "gamersaurus" within my database and applying the index to that. What I needed to use was this:

    ```mongo.db.thesaurus.create_index([("term", "text"), ("definition", "text"), ("example", "text")])```
    
    + This created the index in the appropriate location and my search function worked as intended.

+ **Buttons in Term Control** - I added a container for the search feature and decided to include an "Add Term" button with my own if/else loop to manage the responsive styling.
    + My first attempt had the if/else loop containing the two different divs but this affected the form submission. 
        + To solve this I used jinja templating to change the top level divs for s4 and s6 based on ```{% if session.user %}```.
    + In an attempt to make the buttons the same size I converted my a tags to buttons but ran into issues with the form submission.
        + To solve this I changed my buttons back to a links and added the class of "button" to them which produced the same effect and a functioning site.
